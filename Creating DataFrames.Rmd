This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 



Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.


The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
```{r}
# Create the data frame.
library.data <- data.frame(
   bookID = c (1:5), 
   bookName = c("Mills and Boon","Harry Potter","Percy Jackson","Twilight","The hunger games"),
   price = c(623.3,515.2,611.0,729.0,843.25),
   stringsAsFactors = FALSE 
   )
# Print the data frame.			
print(library.data) 
```
```{r}
#Get the structure of the data frame
str(library.data)

```
```{r}
print(summary(library.data))
```

```{r}
result = library.data[1:2,]
print(result)
```

```{r}
# Extract 
result <- library.data[c(1,2)]
print(result)
```

```{r}

```
